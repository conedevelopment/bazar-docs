## Introduction

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to Bazar. We appreciate your time and effort in making this e-commerce package better. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

Following these guidelines helps communicate that you respect the developers' time managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Ground Rules

Responsibilities
* Create issues for any significant changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently, and get community feedback.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature perversion.

### All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Open a pull request!

## Your First Contribution

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

Are you working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Because this is a Laravel based project, we follow the related best practices.
